House Price Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Overview

This is a practice project aimed at predicting house prices using a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. The dataset used is the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets. The project explores how factors like house size, number of rooms, location, median income, and population affect housing prices.

Dataset


The dataset contains the following features:

  MedINC: Median income of residents in the area
   
 HouseAge: Age of the house

 AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household

 AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household

 Population: Population of the area

 AveOccup: Average number of occupants per household

 Longitude & Latitude: Geographic location of the house

Model

The project implements Support Vector Regression (SVR) with feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

Steps:

Load the dataset

Preprocess the data (scaling, splitting into training and test sets)

Train the SVR model

Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
